This work presents an small industrial setup replica for inspection and rejection of objects on a conveyor line. It explains the stepwise calibration of an Intel RealSense L515 RGBD camera and Hand
to Eye Calibration of a UR3E robot and accuracy validation based on practical tests. 

It includes the design and integration of a conveyor system with the robot and cameragripper assembly to perform pick and place operation based on Image (2D) to World (3D) coordinate transformations and various image processing techniques. Three different conveyor inspection scenarios are replicated to detect the objects on the basis of size, color and deficient bolts and integrated on a single program with online visualization of results.

Below is the images for the digital twin setup and the original setup of the robotic cell.
