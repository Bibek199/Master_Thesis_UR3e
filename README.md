This work presents an small industrial setup replica for inspection and rejection of objects on a conveyor line. It explains the stepwise calibration of an Intel RealSense L515 RGBD camera and Hand
to Eye Calibration of a UR3E robot and accuracy validation based on practical tests. 

It includes the design and integration of a conveyor system with the robot and cameragripper assembly to perform pick and place operation based on Image (2D) to World (3D) coordinate transformations and various image processing techniques. Three different conveyor inspection scenarios are replicated to detect the objects on the basis of size, color and deficient bolts and integrated on a single program with online visualization of results.

Hereby, I share my final report, presentation and complete code i this repopsitory for your reference to build up on project concept and carry out improvements and in case of any questions feel free to contact me.

# Objectives

Primary:
1. Develop and Integrate a Vision-guided robotic system for the purpose of Inspection and Classification.
2. Design and Integration of a Robotic Cell: Conveyor system with UR3E Robot.
3. Develop Object-Detection algorithm for classification and pick-place action.

Secondary:
1. Optimize Camera and Hand-eye calibration for accurate operation.
2. Improvement of Detection and Inspection algorithm in a dynamic scenario.
